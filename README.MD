# Ray Tracing Shadow Simulation in Python 3.13.2

## Overview

This application demonstrates a real-time ray tracing shadow simulation using Pygame. It accurately models light rays interacting with a movable sphere, casting dynamic shadows. The simulation is designed to illustrate fundamental concepts of optics and ray tracing.

---

## Features

- Real-time light and shadow rendering using ray tracing.
- Interactive movement of the sphere and light source using keyboard controls.
- Realistic shadows and light occlusion.
- Adjustable parameters for more dense or sparse rays.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.13.2** or higher
- **Pygame 2.5.0** or higher
- **NumPy 1.25.2** or higher

We recommend creating a virtual environment for running the script and installing the dependencies to avoid it interfering with the main system.

To create a Virtual Environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .
```
Navigate to the folder **Scripts**:

```bash
cd venv/Scripts
```

Activate the Virtual Environment:

For Windows users:
```powershell
.\activate.bat
```
For Linux users:
```bash
source ./activate.sh
```

To deactivate the Virtual Environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```
or use the requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone or download the repository containing the script.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the scriptâ€™s directory.
4. Run the script using:

```bash
python -m Ray_Tracing.py
```

## Controls

Set the required parameters of the Rays, Light Source and the Sphere and then click **Start Simulation** button to start the simulation. The default values are already filled in for reference.

Use the following keys to move the sphere and light source:

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the sphere in the respective direction.
- **WASD Keys**: Move the Light Source in the respective direction.
- **Close Button**: Exit the simulation.

---

## Expected Behavior

- Light rays are cast from a fixed light source.
- The sphere casts realistic shadows, blocking light rays dynamically.
- When the sphere overlaps the light source, the source is obscured.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Python 3.13.2 and required packages are installed.
- If the simulation runs slowly, reduce the number of rays in the script.
- If errors occur, verify correct package versions are installed.
- Try using the pre-built **exe** file under releases for simplicity.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Soft shadows using multiple light sources.
- Realistic refraction and reflection effects.
- Eclipse simulation with more accurate optical effects.
